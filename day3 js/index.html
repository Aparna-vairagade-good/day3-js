    <h1>DAY3 INTERVIEW QOUTIONS</h1>
    <h3>//Q1.What is the use of setTimeout</h3> <br>
    The setTimeout() is a method inside the window object, it calls the specified function or <br>
evaluates a JavaScript expression provided as a string after a given time period for only once. <br>
We all have used alarms or reminders several times, this setTimeout() method also has the <br>
same purpose in web applications. We use this to delay some kind of executions. <br> <br>
Syntax: setTimeout(()=>{ <br>
code  <br>
}, time); <br>
 <h3>//Q2.What is callback hell</h3> <br>
 Callback Hell is a pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and <br>
 debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like a pyramid structure. <br> <br>
 async1(function(){ <br>
    async2(function(){ <br>
        async3(function(){ <br>
            async4(function(){ <br>
                .... <br>
            }); <br>
        }); <br>
    }); <br>
}); <br>

<h3>//Q3.What are promises and why do we need them?</h3> <br>
A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created.  <br>
It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure . <br>
<br>
It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason.  <br>
This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, <br>
the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future. <br> <br>

<h3>//Q4.What is promise chaining.</h3> <br>

The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is <br>
known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result, <br> <br>

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { <br>

    setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000); <br>
}).then(function(result) { <br>
    console.log(result); // 1  <br>
    return result * 2; <br>
}).then(function(result) { <br>
    console.log(result); // 2  <br>
    return result * 3;  <br>
}).then(function(result) { <br>
    console.log(result); // 6  <br>
    return result * 4; <br>
}); <br> <br>

In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow  <br>
1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second, <br>
2. After that .then handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with <br>
the value of result * 2. <br>
3. After that the value passed to the next .then handler by logging the result(2) and return a <br>
promise with result * 3. <br>
4. Finally the value passed to the last .then handler by logging the result(6) and return a <br>
promise with result * 4. <br>

<h3>//Q5.What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</h3> <br>
The async keyword turns a method into an async method, which allows you to use the await keyword in its body.  <br>
 When the await keyword is applied, it suspends the calling method and yields control back to its caller until the awaited task is complete.  <br>
 await can only be used inside an async method. <br>

example: <br>
function resolveAfter2Seconds() <br>
return new Promise(resolve => <br>
{ <br>
    setTimeout(() => { <br>
        resolve('resolved') <br>
    }, 2000); <br>
});  <br>
} <br>
async function asyncCall() { <br>
    console.log('calling'); <br>
    const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds(); <br>
    console.log(result); <br>
    // expected output: "resolved"  


<h3>//Q6.What is the DOM?</h3> <br>
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the <br>
structure and content of a document on the web. <br> <br> <br>
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It <br>
represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. <br>
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can <br>
interact with the page. <br>



Example: <br>
Write code to get 1st H1 element from a webpage using DOM <br>
var result=document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0]; <br>

<h3>//Q7.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3> <br>
Undefined : <br>
undefined is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. JavaScript assigns undefined <br>
to any variable that has been declared but not initialized. In other words, in a case where no <br>
value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it undefined. <br> <br><br>
Null : <br>
It is one of JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data type and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.null is <br>
an empty or non-existent value and null must be assigned. We use null when we want to <br>
explicitly declare that a variable is empty. <br> <br> <br>
 Not Defined : <br>
A not defined is a variable that is not declared inside the code at a given point of time with <br>
declaration keyword like var, let, or const. <br>
